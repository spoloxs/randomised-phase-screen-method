# Phase Screen Generation for Optical Turbulence

This repository provides an implementation of phase screen generation methods based on the paper [Closed-form expressions for phase screens](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAB.36.003249). The methods efficiently model low-frequency distortions in optical systems, and the implementation validates the results with analytical models and traditional methods.

## Overview
The code provides a MATLAB-based simulation of optical turbulence, incorporating the techniques outlined in the referenced article. It includes methods for generating phase screens and applying them to model optical distortions, with results that align with both analytical predictions and established methods.

## Usage
To run the simulation, you can use the provided MATLAB scripts and functions for phase screen generation. Detailed instructions are included in the repository.
